# Apple Reminders KPI Reporter

Apple Reminders KPI Reporter is for the people interested in getting a report that contains KPIs about the progress they
have made over their personal or work related tasks that are tracked in the reminders app found in apple products. This
project is a WIP and is not usable at the moment. I am in still in the process of packaging the tool. I plan to add 
functionality as time goes by, but  for now these are the KPIs that are included in the report:

* Number of tasks initated and completed 
* Diagram that includes a bar chart that acts as a burn down chart
* Diagram that includes a pie chart that shows distribution among the tasks categories
* Tasks completed or initiated with a priority set
